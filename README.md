# Nuix Test App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

You’ve been tasked with building React components to list and display details of items, and you have received this rough mockup and access to the backend application that exposes the REST API.

* Use ReactJS, feel free to use Material UI as a component library (or create them from scratch).
* You have total freedom to style the components. Be creative!
* Prefer TypeScript, but send JavaScript if you feel more comfortable.
* Extra points if you use redux (rather than React’s reducer) for the model.

## Project Key Dependencies

* React V18.3.1
* Redux V9.1.2
* Ant Design V5.22.2
* Styled-components V6.1.13

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode using .env.development file for local API
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
